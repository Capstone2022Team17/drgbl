#About

Each of these contain signals for 512 clock cycles while running a read or write command. The signals for the alveo board are named after the commands run during a read or write to the hbm memory. For example, ```mem\_write\_0x40000000\_0x12345678``` is an ILA run looking at signals for the axi interface and cpu busses while running the command ```mem_write``` with address 0x40000000 and data 0x12345678. The trigger was set for the dbus\_dat\_w signal to turn to 0x12345678. ```mem\_read\_0x40000000\_soc\_cpu\_dbus\_adr\_0x10000000``` is an ILA run with the same signals while running ```mem\_read``` with address 0x40000000 with the trigger set for the signal soc\_cpu\_dbus\_adr to turn to 0x10000000, the address that appears when reading or writing from address 0x40000000, and 0x10400000 with address 0x41000000. The others are run with the same ```mem\_read``` command while waiting for the ```ar\_valid``` signal to go high.
